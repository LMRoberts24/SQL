-- Backstory, Jesse is an upcoming senior and data science major at Yellow Brick Road State College (Kansas City Campus). He recently landed a one-year internship at Wicked Green Tech,
a public health startup, in the heart of Emerald City, where he will be working as a junior data analyst. Knowing that this is once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Jesse, along with his
parakeet "Munchkin" travels to the big city with a tattered leather suitcase and a dream.

-- A full day has passed since Jesse's arrival to Emerald City. He decides to head over to the superstore, with a modest budget, to get some home essentials to make
his 425 sq ft studio apartment more habitable.

-- This project utilizes the following Superstore data:

CREATE TABLE superstore (
    item_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    item_name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INTEGER,
    average_rating DECIMAL(3, 2)
);

INSERT INTO superstore (item_id, item_name, category, price, stock_quantity, average_rating)
VALUES
    (1, 'Stainless Steel Cookware Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 89.99, 50, 4.6),
    (2, 'Memory Foam Mattress', 'Furnishings', 499.99, 30, 4.8),
    (3, 'Smart LED TV', 'Electronics', 549.00, 20, 4.5),
    (4, 'Robot Vacuum Cleaner', 'Appliances', 199.50, 40, 4.3),
    (5, 'Wireless Bluetooth Speaker', 'Electronics', 39.99, 60, 4.2),
    (6, 'Non-Stick Baking Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 29.95, 80, 4.4),
    (7, 'Cotton Bedding Set', 'Furnishings', 89.00, 25, 4.7),
    (8, 'Smart Home Security Camera', 'Electronics', 79.95, 15, 4.1),
    (9, 'Air Purifier', 'Appliances', 129.50, 35, 4.6),
    (10, 'Premium Coffee Maker', 'Kitchen Supplies', 79.99, 50, 4.9),
    (11, 'Ergonomic Office Chair', 'Furnishings', 189.00, 20, 4.5),
    (12, 'Wireless Earbuds', 'Electronics', 49.99, 75, 4.3),
    (13, 'Slow Cooker', 'Appliances', 49.95, 30, 4.7),
    (14, 'Cutlery Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 34.50, 40, 4.4),
    (15, 'Cozy Throw Blanket', 'Furnishings', 24.99, 100, 4.2);

-- For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store, their prices, and their ratings.

-- Use a SELECT statement to list only the Kitchen Supplies from most to least expensive.

SELECT category, item_name, price
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies'
ORDER BY price desc;

-- Determine the average rating of Furnishings.

SELECT category, item_name, average_rating
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Furnishings'
ORDER BY average_rating >=4.5;

-- Show a statistic about the item prices.

SELECT avg(price)
FROM superstore;

-- Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies". 

SELECT avg(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Kitchen Supplies"

-- Determine the total number of Electronics that are available for to purchase.

SELECT category, item_name, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Electronics'
ORDER BY stock_quantity >=true; 

-- Use a SELECT statement to verify all Appliances that cost more than 49.99.

SELECT category, item_name, price
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Appliances'
ORDER BY price > 49.99 desc;

-- Conclusion, Jesse ends up purchasing the memory foam mattress, cotton bedding set, stainless steel cookware set, and the cutlery set
